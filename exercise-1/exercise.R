# Exercise 1: Creating and Indexing Vectors

# Create a vector `x` that has the values 10 through 20 in it (using the : operator)


# Create a vector `y` that has the values 21 through 30 in it (using the seq() function)


# Create a vector `z` by combining the vectors `x` and `y`


# Create a variable `w` that contains the 11th element in your vector `z`


# Create a vector `q` that contains the second through the 5 elements of `z`


# Create a variable `len` that is equal to the length of your vector `q`


### Bonus ###

# Create a vector `even` that holds the even numbers from 1 to 100


# Using the `all()` function and `%%` (modulo) operator, confirm that all of the
# numbers in your `even` vector are even
